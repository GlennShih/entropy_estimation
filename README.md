# entropy_estimation

The sourcedemo.c file contain the estimation of entropy with different table size value from 2^14 ~ 2^19 by Clifford and Cosma approach.

The random_produce.c calculate the H(p) function in the algorithm

The pcg_nomask.c and rand_nomask.c are two different random number generator, using pcg() and rand() in C.
